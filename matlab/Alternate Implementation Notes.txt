Alternate Implementation Notes

input - concatatenation of latteral + bottom up

sounds like a simple baysian calculation

on 8x8 (lateral by bottom up) 
or 1 onehot 1x64


"simple bayesian update of probabilities"

start with a prior where each is weighted equally

1 /5 and 1/5 6

64 possibile inputs and 8 possible outcomes

only update priors for the situation that comes in
